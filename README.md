**fluxplayercli** - proof of concept of `libav*` and `portaudio` audio player implementation in Rust.

Note: The (code) insides are not idiomatic Rust and/or good code in anyway; This is just a side project to experiment with Rust wrapper and see if it's easier to work with than C/C++. (Spoiler: It is)
